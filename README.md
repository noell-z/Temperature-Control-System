Our project focuses on designing a window comparator system for temperature control in a mechanical workshop. Our system monitors a temperature range of 20°C to 30°C and initiates a series of actions based on the surrounding temperature which includes displaying the temperature status on an LCD, activating a fan when the temperature exceeds 30°C, and controlling the fan speed using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The fan’s speed is measured and displayed on the LCD.
